# etch-a-sketch
Project: Etch-a-Sketch from The Odin Project curriculum in the JavaScript
Basics section of the Foundations course.

Coming right after the Rock Paper Scissors project in the curriculum,
this Etch-a-Sketch project is meant to further push the knowledge that we
have acquired throughout this section of the curriculum. This project
consists of creating a web toy that is something between a sketchpad
and an Etch-a-Sketch. and it will deal a lot more with DOM manipulation
and event handling, and all of the basic JavaScript skills overall.
